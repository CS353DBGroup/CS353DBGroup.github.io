                <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
                <p>This Project proposal is for a Social Network for Check-ins. It will contain a brief description of the application we make, show the non-functional and functional requirements, discuss limitations and restrictions of our database and how system is going to be integrated will be shown with the  E/R model of our database.</p>
                <p>The proposal starts with Project Description which contains brief information about the Project and we will try to Show how database will be used in this Project. It will continue with an explanation of why we need a database for Social Network for Check-ins and how we can use database for this project.</p>
                <p>The proposal continues with requirements. In this part, functional and nonfunctional requirements will be examined and there will be an explanation for our pseudo requirements. Functional requirements are a must for setting up the functionalities and properties of project, which will be acquire by analyzing the users.  The nonfunctional requirements will be about the performance, reliability, security and usability goals for our system. In pseudo requirements , we will examine the technologies we will use in our system. In the limitations section, we will discuss the boundaries of our system.</p>
                <p>At the end of the proposal, we will have our E/R diagram which is a basis for our database system.</p>
                
                <h3>2. Project Description</h3>
                <p>This application will be a web based system for making check-ins in different places, make comments about places and rating the places by their judgment, which is similar to FourSquare.   The system will be used by regular people and owners of the places. System will include different ID’s for different users which they will login and add friends with those ID’s. There will be a password for each user which will be required in the login page. There will be also information about the names, comments and rates about the places in our database.</p>
                <p>Regular users will be able to see those data in the application and change them according to their want by making a comment or rating the place they go. They will be able to search for places and friends and see the profiles of their friends, add friends by sending a friend request and see friend requests. In addition to this, application will have a news feed page, which will contains regular users’ friends’ latest check-ins, comments and ratings about the place chronologically. Regular users will also be able to make comments to their friends’ check-ins.</p>
                <p>Our system will be also used by the owners of the places. Owners will have a permission to add their places in our database, so that regular users can search the name of the place and check-in.</p>
                <p>All users will be able to change settings in the application’s setting menu, which will have options for security and privacy. Users also be able to change their password, name, and e-mail address in this menu.</p>
                <p>Also, when users make a check-in in a location, application will notify the user if one of their friends’ ever visited the place before. So that user can see the rating and comment of his or her friend.</p>
